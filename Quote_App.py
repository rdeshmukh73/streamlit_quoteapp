    My name is Raghavendra Deshmukh - a Software Rookie who is trying to learn a few new things about building software.
    
    I live in :blue[Bangalore, India].  I am enthusiastic about Indian Music, Cricket, Software, Leadership, People development and Blockchain.

    I have been motivated by a lot of good Quotes that are available via various sources.
    I am building this app to load Quotes and make them available for consumption. 
    ### What can we do with this App
    - Get a Random Quote
    - Add a New Quote
    - Get a Quote for a Chosen Author
